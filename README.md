# antenna-tracking

This antenna tracker project currently interperets Ardupilot Serial "PAN" commands to operate a stepper motor driver.
It formally contained Arduino code to translate servo PWM values to operate stepper motors (please look at commits before Apr 27 '19 for this code)
More may be added later.
See comments in each file for an in-depth explanation for its operation.
